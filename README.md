## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require bright-components/service
```

Then, run:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```
and choose the BrightComponents/Service option.

This will copy the package configuration (service.php) to your 'config' folder.
Here, you can set your namespaces and also map your Service definitions to their appropriate handler class.

## Usage

BrightComponents/Service draws heavily from Laravel's Job dispatching component, therefore, the implementation and usage is very similar to dispatching jobs in Laravel. I simply wanted to be able to differentiate between 'jobs' and 'service' classes when perusing the codebase.

Once the package is installed, the config is copied, you can begin generating your Service classes and Handlers.
To generate a Service class and Handler, run:
```bash
php artisan make:service StoreNewTaskService
```
This will create a 'StoreNewTaskService' class and a 'StoreNewTaskServiceHandler' class according to the namespaces you set in the service.php config file.

Next, in the config file, you can map the Service to the Task. See example below:
```php
    'handlers' => [
        'App\Services\Definitions\StoreNewTaskService' => 'App\Services\Handlers\StoreNewTaskServiceHandler',
    ],
```

Now, you can call your service by using the included trait (CallsServices):
```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use BrightComponents\Service\Traits\CallsServices;

class StoreTaskController extends StoreTaskController
{
    use CallsServices;

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $task = $this->call(new StoreNewTaskService($request->all()));

        return view('tasks.show', ['task' => $task]);
    }
}
```
As in the example above, simply pass any necessary data to your service definition constructor. The service and its associated data will be available in the 'run' method of the Handler. In your Handler class, you may typehint any dependencies needed in the class constructor and they will be resolved from the Container by Laravel.
