### Disclaimer
The packages under the BrightComponents namespace are basically a way for me to avoid copy/pasting simple functionality that I like in all of my projects. There's nothing groundbreaking here, just a little extra functionality for form requests, controllers, custom rules, services, etc.

BrightComponents' Service package scratches an itch I've had for a while. I routinely use single-action controllers with [Responder Classes](https://github.com/bright-components/responders), in combination with Service classes for gathering/manipulating data. In the past, I used Laravel's jobs(synchronous) for my services. There were times, though, that I needed to use jobs as well and didn't like that they were difficult to differentiate from my Service classes. Now, a quick look at my 'Services' folder and I can see a clear picture of all of my application services and my controllers are super clean!

Example:
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers\Tasks;

use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Services\StoreNewTaskService;
use App\Http\Requests\StoreNewTaskRequest;
use App\Http\Responders\Task\StoreResponder;
use BrightComponents\Services\Traits\CallsServices; // the trait could be added to your parent Controller class

class Store extends Controller
{
    use CallsServices;

    /**
     * The service used to store a new task.
     *
     * @var \App\Http\Responders\Task\StoreResponder
     */
    private $responder;

    /**
     * Construct a new Store controller.
     *
     * @param  \App\Http\Responders\Task\StoreResponder  $responder
     */
    public function __construct(StoreResponder $responder)
    {
        $this->responder = $responder;
    }

    /**
     * Handle the task store action.
     *
     * @param  \App\Http\Requests\StoreTaskRequest  $request
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response
     */
    public function __invoke(StoreTaskRequest $request)
    {
        $task = $this->call(new StoreNewTaskService($request->validated()));

        return $this->responder->respond($request, $task);
    }
}

```

My controllers simply defer to a Service to handle the dirty work, then, using [Responders](https://github.com/bright-components/responders), the response is sent. A very clean approach.

## Installation
You can install the package via composer. From your project directory, in your terminal, enter:
```bash
composer require bright-components/services
```
> Note: Until version 1.0 is released, major features and bug fixes may be added between minor versions. To maintain stability, I recommend a restraint in the form of "^0.7.*". This would take the form of:
```bash
composer require "bright-components/services:0.7.*"
```

In Laravel > 5.6.0, the ServiceProvider will be automtically detected and registered.
If you are using an older version of Laravel, add the package service provider to your config/app.php file, in the 'providers' array:
```php
'providers' => [
    //...
    BrightComponents\Services\ServicesServiceProvider::class,
    //...
];
```

### Package Configuration
If you would like to change any of the package configuration options, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish
```
and choose the 'BrightComponents/Services' option.

This will copy the package configuration (service-classes.php) to your 'config' folder.
See the configuration file below, for all options available:

```php
return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Namespaces
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Set the namespace for Service classes.
    |
    */
    'namespace' => 'Services',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Suffixes
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Set the suffix for the Service classes.
    |
    */
    'suffix' => 'Service',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Method Name
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Set the method name for handling services.
    |
     */
    'method' => 'run',

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Duplicate Suffixes
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | If you have a Service suffix set in the config and try to generate a Service that also includes the suffix,
    | the package will recognize this duplication and rename the Service to remove the extra suffix.
    | This is the default behavior. To override and allow the duplication, change to false.
    |
    */
    'override_duplicate_suffix' => true,
];
```

## Usage
Once the package is installed and the config is copied (optionally), you can begin generating your Services.

### Generating a Service class
From inside your project directory, in your terminal, run:

```bash
php artisan bright:service StoreNewTask
```

Based on the configuration options above, this will create an 'App\Services\StoreNewTaskService' class.

> Note, by default, the 'run' method will be called when you 'call' your service. You can change this method name in the configuration file.

Example Service class:

```php
// Service Class
namespace App\Services;

use App\Models\Repositories\TaskRepository;
use BrightComponents\Common\Payloads\Payload;

class StoreNewTaskService
{
    /**
     * The parameters for building a new Task.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    public $params;

    /**
     * Construct a new StoreNewTaskService.
     *
     * @param  array  $params
     */
    public function __construct(array $params)
    {
        $this->params = $params;
    }

    /**
     * Handle the call to the service.
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function run(TaskRepository $repo)
    {
        $task = $repo->create($this->params);

        return new Payload(['task' => $task]);
    }
}
```
As in the example above, simply pass any necessary data to your service constructor. You may typehint any dependencies needed by your service in the 'run' method, and they will be resolved from the container by Laravel.
> Your Service class can ultimately return any type you need. If you prefer having a consistent return type from all of your services, you may choose to utilize the Payload class. The Payload classes are included in the [bright-components/common package](https://github.com/bright-components/common). A Payload is a wrapper for the data being sent back to your controller. You can extend the AbstractPayload class, or use one of the generic Payload classes included(Payload and ErrorPayload). *These classes do not have any functionality at the moment. Future releases prior to 1.0 may introduce methods and/or properties for these classes.*

### Calling Services
There are a few options for calling a service. The first example below, utilizes the included "CallsServices" trait. You may include this trait in your base controller so that all controllers have access.
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Services\StoreNewTaskService;
use BrightComponents\Services\Traits\CallsServices;

class StoreTaskController extends StoreTaskController
{
    use CallsServices;

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $task = $this->call(new StoreNewTaskService($request->all()));

        return view('tasks.show', ['task' => $task]);
    }
}
```

The next option is to include the ServiceCaller via dependency injection, the use the "call" method:
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use BrightComponents\Services\ServiceCaller;
use App\Services\StoreNewTaskService;

class StoreTaskController extends StoreTaskController
{
    use CallsServices;

    private $service;

    public function __construct(ServiceCaller $service)
    {
        $this->service = $service;
    }

    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $task = $this->service->call(new StoreNewTaskService($request->all()));

        return view('tasks.show', ['task' => $task]);
    }
}
```

Finally, like Jobs in Laravel, the service has the ability to call itself:
```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Services\StoreNewTaskService;

class StoreTaskController extends StoreTaskController
{
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        $task = StoreNewTaskService::call($request->all());

        return view('tasks.show', ['task' => $task]);
    }
}
```
